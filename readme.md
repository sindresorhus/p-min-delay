# p-min-delay [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/p-min-delay.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/p-min-delay)

> Delay a promise a minimum amount of time

While the [`delay`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/delay) module delays the promise a specified amount of time and then resolves it, this module ensures the promise resolves after the specified amount of time.

Useful when you have a promise that may settle immediately or may take some time, and you want to ensure it doesn't settle too fast. For example, if you want to show a loading indicator for at least 1 second (but longer if needed) to prevent a confusing flash in the UI.


## Install

```
$ npm install --save p-min-delay
```


## Usage

```js
const pMinDelay = require('p-min-delay');

pMinDelay(somePromise, 1000)
	.then(value => {
		// executed after minimum 1 second even if `somePromise` fulfills before that
	})
	.catch(error => {
		// executed right away regardless of delay if `somePromise` rejects
	});
```


## API
